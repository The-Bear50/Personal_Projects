## Reason for using this PC as a server :computer:
Since I'd like to run multiple VM's during the same time, while keeping the server on at all-time and I'd also would like to ensure I have some space to back-up data and keep some space for future projects. getting 32gb of RAM and a 1TO SSD made the more sense. There's also some scalability to it as I have an additionnal SSD port that is not yet used.
