## The Mission

[Here](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-k4MK4r-2/blob/main/content/02-Linux/09-Projects/02-Monitoring_101.md) is the aim of this project summarized.

## The report

### Executive summary

### Introduction
After going into the theory in the above PDF file, let's use the tools mentionned to monitor our own machine.

### Server Structure Overview
•	Detailed description of the server architecture, including:
o	Hardware components (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage)
o	Software stack (e.g., operating system, web server, database server)
o	Network topology (e.g., load balancers, firewalls, routers)
•	Diagrams or visual representations may be helpful for clarity.

### Monitoring Strategy

### Risks and Threats
•	Identify potential risks to server infrastructure:
o	Hardware failures
o	Software vulnerabilities
o	Cybersecurity threats (e.g., malware, DDoS attacks)
o	Human errors
•	Assess the impact of these risks on performance, security, and availability.

### Conclusion
•	Summarize key findings and recommendations.
•	Highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk management for maintaining server infrastructure health.
