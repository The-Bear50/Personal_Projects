# El Doctor - A monitoring tool to rule them all!

- Module: Scripting
- Competence: is able to write a custom script to monitor machines
- Type of Challenge: Consolidation
- Duration: 3 day
- Deadline: 12/04/2024
- Participants: : solo

## The Mission

[Here](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-k4MK4r-2/blob/main/content/02-Linux/09-Projects/03-El_Doctor.md) is the summarized scope of this project.

## Personal setup 

What I'd like for this monitoring script to be displaying when ran, and sent via mail, is the following :

- Greeting message + mention of anything weird having been recorded.
- Specs of the machine monitored :
    - CPU.
    - RAM.
    - Disk space.
    - Network used.
    - Number of users connected and their names.
    - Uptime
- Current state of these specs.
- Mention of the hour as of which the next monitoring will take place.

## Things to be done 

- Writing a bash script triggering all monitoring
- Testing it
- Ensuring it is sent by mail
- Writing a cron job so that the moniroting script gets automated

### Writing the script

Since I'm not yet very competent in writing scripts, I'll get some help from the internet and our friend ChatGPT to get the first structure of our bash codes.
After tweaking it a bit to my own needs, I got five different scripts that'll trigger every command I need :
