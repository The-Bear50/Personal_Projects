# Small company's network build - "Hackers Poulette" 🐔

The above .pkt file displays the fictional company's "Hackers Poulette" network.

## What is this network made of ? 🖥️

- Two subnets for the company's network, each containing three hosts and one switch.
- One router that connexts these two subnets together to ensure connectivity between the company's team
- One server that hosts the company's website. The server has its DNS service enabled so that by typing the site's name into any of the hosts' browser, you'd reach Poulette's extranet.


## What should be implemented in the future? 📆

- A DMZ, so that incoming connections from the outside world will not reach the company's intranet.
- A firewall to filter any in and out-going connections.
- In case of an increase of the network's size, the custom 192.168.1.0/29 subnet of the company should be adapted to include those new hosts.
- An adaptation of the router and switches should this increase ever occur.
