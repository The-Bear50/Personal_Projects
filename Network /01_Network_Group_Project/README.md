# Build a secure network

We've been asked, through Packet Tracer, to build a network design that would be secure, manageable and scalable for a fictive company. You can find the requirements here below, and all explanations in the above PDF file. This file also contains an executive summary that'll help you understand our teamwork and implementations at a glance.

Enjoy your reading!

## Requirements

        Network diagram with annotations.
        IP addressing table per sector and VLAN (if used).
        Configuration details for key devices.
        Explanation of security measures and their purpose.
        Cost breakdown of network components.

- Client's wishes:

        Active Directory and DNS server

        DHCP server
