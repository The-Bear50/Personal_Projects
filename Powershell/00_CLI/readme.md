## Powershell CLI - Trial of might 💪

This is no proper project per se, but rather a simple txt file encrypted via GPG. File which contains all passwords to the underthewire.tech's levels, which is a website that challenges you to a Powershell-based CTF.

## How to decrypt it ? 🔐

1) Use your private key to decrypt the first layer of the message (if you aren't Lil4shad, then too bad!)
2) Use my publick key to decrypt the second layer.
3) Enjoy !

## Personal conclusion 🌻
